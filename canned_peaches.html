                                <h3>Peachlore</h3>
                                <p>Peaches have been around the block. Their Latin name, <em>Prunus persica</em>, means "Persian apple." But, fun twist, they're actually native to China, where folks were enjoying them growing wild as far back as 10th century BC! From there, this fruit hit the road: Persians brought it west to Rome in the early 200s BC, and Alexander the Great made sure Europe got a taste during his explorations. Fast-forward a few centuries, and Spanish explorers tossed some peaches into their bags for the Americas in the 1500s.</p>
                                <p>Then came the Napoleonic Wars, and suddenly canned peaches started pulling double duty, feeding troops and sticking around as a wartime staple. These days, canned peaches are still shelf royalty. In Northern China, people believe they bring healing, luck, and even a hint of immortality. Which, honestly, feels like a pretty good reason to keep a few jars in the pantry!</p>
                                <p>Globally, there are more than 2,000 peach varieties, with about 300 grown right here in the U.S. They're part of the rose family, closely related to almonds, and only one gene separates a peach from its smooth-skinned cousin, the nectarine.</p>
                                <p>Beyond their charm and flavor, peaches are no slouch in the nutritional department. They're loaded with vitamins A, C, and E, deliver fiber and potassium, and bring antioxidants to the table. So while they taste like sunshine in a can, they're also a powerhouse in a jar.</p>

                                    <h3>Instructions</h3>
                                    <ol class="step-list">
                                      <li><b>Sterilize Jars:</b> Make sure the jars and rings are clean and sterile (I sterilize them in the dishwasher an hour before starting). Make sure you have new, un-used lids, for a proper seal.</li>
                                      <li><b>Fill water bath canner:</b> add enough water to cover the jars by 1-2 inches once they are immersed in the water. Place on the stove and bring the water to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.</li>
                                      <li><b>Peel Peaches:</b> Fill a separate large pot of water and bring to a high simmer. Add the peaches to the hot water (in batches, if needed), for about 30 seconds. This will help loosen the skins, making them really easy to peel. Remove peaches to an ice water bath, then peel them. The skin should come off really easily. Remove the pit, and cut them into large slices.</li>
                                      <li><b>Fill jars</b> with peaches as you slice them. You can fill them pretty full, and gently tap the bottle on the counter top to help them settle inside.</li>
                                      <li><b>Add Simple Syrup:</b> For light syrup, mix 2 cups of sugar with 6 cups of very hot water. Stir well to dissolve the sugar. Pour some of the simple syrup into each jar, leaving 1/2" headspace at the top. Gently tap the jars to release any air bubbles.</li>
                                      <li><b>Wipe the sides and rims</b> of the jars with a clean rag. Place a clean lid securely on top of each of the jars. Secure with the rings.</li>
                                      <li><b>Process in Waterbath:</b> Use jar lifters or tongs to gently place the jars in your hot water bath (or use the rack to lower them down, if you have one with handles). Add more water to the canner, if needed, to cover the tops of the jars. Cover with the lid and bring water back to a boil. Once boiling, process the jars for 25 minutes.</li>
                                      <li><b>Remove and Rest:</b> Place a large towel or dishrag on your countertop. After the 25 minutes is up, turn the burner off (if you have an electric flat top stove, gently move the pot off the burner) remove the lid and allow the jars to rest in the pot for 5 minutes. Then use tongs or jar lifters to move the jars onto the towel to rest.</li>
                                      <li><b>Check Seals:</b> After a few hours you can check the seals to make sure they all sealed properly before you store them. When you press on the center of the lid it should be sealed down. If you hear or feel it pop back at all, then it didn't seal properly. Also make sure there is still liquid covering the peaches and that the peaches look like a nice bright color. If they didn't seal properly you can refrigerate them and enjoy within a few days, or reprocess in the water bath.</li>
                                      <li><b>Store:</b> Allow the jars to cool completely before storing them in a cool, dry place for 12-18 months.</li>
                                      <li><b>If your peaches start to develop a foul odor, become discolored, or if you see signs of mold, these are signs of spoilage and you should discard them.</b></li>
                                    </ol>

                                        <li><b>Add cinnamon:</b> for a spiced or cinnamon flavor, place one cinnamon stick in the bottom of each jar before adding the peaches.</li>
                                        <li><b>Add vanilla:</b> for a yummy vanilla flavor, add a vanilla bean pod (slit and seeds removed), to the simple syrup when you heat it. Remove it before pouring liquid on peaches.</li>
