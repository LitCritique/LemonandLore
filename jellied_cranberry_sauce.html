                <h3>Cranberry Chronicles</h3>
                <p>Jellied cranberry sauce has earned its spot as a holiday icon, and not just because it holds the shape of the can like a champ. This wobbly wonder has a surprisingly rich backstory that starts way before it hit the Thanksgiving table.</p>
                <p>Cranberries are native to North America, and Indigenous peoples were the first to use them for food, medicine, and dyes. These bitter berries were a way of life for many tribes in the northeaster and Great Lakes regions.  Some of the key tribes known for using cranberries are:
                <ul><li> Algonquin</li><li>Wampanoag</li><li>Lenni-Lenape</li><li>Ojibwe (Chippewa)</li><li>Cree</li><li>Iroquois</li> </ul>Fast-forward to the 1800s, and cranberry farming was booming in the Northeast. But the berries had a short shelf life (just a few weeks in the fall) so growers needed a way to stretch the season.</p>
                <p>Enter Marcus Urann, a lawyer-turned-cranberry farmer with a knack for innovation. In 1912, he started canning cranberry sauce to make it available year-round. His creation? The jellied cranberry ‚Äúlog‚Äù we know and love (or love to hate). By 1941, it was being sold nationwide, and Ocean Spray (the co-op he helped form) was born.</p>
                <p>The secret to that signature jiggle? Pectin‚Äîa natural compound in cranberries that helps them gel when cooked. That‚Äôs why jellied cranberry sauce slices so cleanly and holds its shape like a nostalgic little trophy. Today, Americans consume over 5 million gallons of jellied cranberry sauce every holiday season. Whether you‚Äôre Team Slice, Team Mash, or Team No-Way, the jellied cranberry log is a tradition that‚Äôs stuck around for good reason: it‚Äôs easy, shelf-stable, and tastes like pure holiday comfort (to some).</p>

                  <h3>Instructions</h3>
                  <ol class="step-list">
                    <li><b>Prepare:</b> canner, jars, and lids.</li>
                    <li><b>Combine:</b> cranberries, apple juice, and water in a large stainless steel saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and keep at a simmer for about 10 minutes until cranberries soften and skins burst. Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li><b>Transfer: </b> the cranberry mixture to a food mill or saucemaker to remove skins. Alternatively, blend in a blender until completely smooth.</li>
                    <li><b>Return: </b>cranberry puree to the saucepan. Add sugar and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Once the sugar is dissolved, and the mixture keeps boiling even when stirred, set the timer for 10 minutes. Stir constantly. At ten minutes, remove from heat and test to see if the gel stage has been reached. If not, keep boiling for another 5 minutes and test again. If the gel stage has been reached, stir in orange zest..</li>
                    <li><b>Ladle:</b> hot cranberry sauce into hot jars, leaving ¬º inch headspace. Wipe rims with hot water. Center lid on jar and add ring to jar, tightening until fingertip tight.</li>
                    <li><b>Place: </b> jars in the canner. Water should cover the jars by at least one inch. </li>
                    <li><b>Bring to a boil:</b> and process for 15 minutes plus any additional time needed for altitude adjustment. </li>
                    <li><b>Remove:</b> Remove canner lid. Wait 5-10 minutes. Remove jars from canner. Wait 12-24 hours before removing rings and testing seals. Ideal storage temperature is 50-70¬∫F.</li>
                    
                    
                   
                    <b>If your peaches start to develop a foul odor, become discolored, or if you see signs of mold, these are signs of spoilage and you should discard them.</b>
