                                <h3>Jamlore: Strawberry Lemon Edition</h3>
                              <p>Don't let the cheerful color fool you! Strawberry lemon jam has some serious history behind it. Jam, especially fruit preserved in sugar, goes way back. We‚Äôre talking Ancient Rome, when honey and boiled fruit were stored in clay pots! In medieval Europe, jam-making became a sign of care and abundance, with copper kettles bubbling away in cottage kitchens. It was a way to stretch the harvest, protect against spoilage, and prepare for leaner months.</p>
                                <p>Now, let's look at those strawberries. They‚Äôve been growing wild for thousands of years, popping up in Europe, North America, and even South America. But the big, juicy berries we know and love today? Those came from a botanical love story in the 1700s when two different species‚Äîone from Chile, one from France‚Äîwere crossbred into the modern garden strawberry. Before that, strawberries were smaller, tarter, and mostly used for medicine. People believed they could clean your teeth, purify your blood, and bring a little sweetness to a bitter world.</p>
                              <p>Lemons have their own journey. Originally from Northwestern India,  they are though to be a hybrid of the citron and bitter orange. They were introduced to Southern Italy around 200 AD and cultivated in Egypt and Iran by 700 ADthey didn‚Äôt reach Europe until around the Crusades. And they didn‚Äôt really take off until sailors realized they helped prevent scurvy (thanks, Vitamin C!). By the 1600s, lemons were prized for their flavor, cleaning power, and their ability to keep folks healthy on long voyages.</p>
                              <p>So remember: when you stir together fresh strawberries, lemon juice, and a touch of sugar, you're not just making a sunny spread for morning toast. You're connecting to centuries of resourcefulness, trade routes, health hacks, and a whole lot of kitchen wisdom passed from one generation to the next. It‚Äôs bright, tangy, and practical, and it reminds us how something so simple can carry so much story!</P

                                  <h4>ü•Ñ Before You Begin:</h4>
                                  <ol class="step-list">
                                      <li><b>Prepare your jars and canner:</b> Fill a boiling water canner with water and begin heating it.

Place 4 half-pint jars in the simmering water to warm. Don‚Äôt boil them‚Äîjust keep them hot until you're ready to fill.</li>
                                      <li><b> Make calcium water (only if needed):</b> Mix ¬Ω teaspoon calcium powder (comes with Pomona‚Äôs Pectin) with ¬Ω cup water in a jar. Shake well. You‚Äôll use just 2 teaspoons of this mixture.</li>
                                    <h4>üçì Strawberry Prep:</h4>
                                      <li><b>Wash and prep the strawberries</b> Rinse berries thoroughly, remove leafy tops, and slice into quarters. 
Place in a large bowl and mash with a potato masher or fork until you have about 4 cups mashed.</li>
                                     
                                    <h4>üçØ Mix Pectin:</h4>
                                    <li><b>Combine pectin with sweetener:</b>In a separate small bowl, stir together 2 teaspoons Pomona‚Äôs Pectin and your honey (or sugar) until fully blended.</li>
                                    <h4>üçã Cook the Jam:</h4>
                                      <li><b>Heat fruit mixture
:</b> In a large saucepan, combine mashed strawberries, lemon juice, lemon zest, and 2 teaspoons calcium water. Stir and heat the mixture until it reaches a full rolling boil (one that doesn‚Äôt stop when stirred).</li>
                                      <li><b>Add the pectin blend:</b> Stir in the pectin-honey mixture continuously.

Bring the jam back to a full boil and keep boiling for 1‚Äì2 minutes.

Remove from heat.</li>
                                    <h4>ü´ô Fill and Process:</h4>
                                      <li><b>Fill the jars: </b> Use a ladle to pour jam into your warm jars, leaving ¬º inch of headspace at the top.

Wipe jar rims clean with a damp cloth.

Center the lids and screw on the bands until fingertip-tight.</li>

                                                                   <li><b>Process in the canner: </b> Place jars in the boiling water canner with at least 1 inch of water covering them.

Bring to a full boil and process for 10 minutes (adjust time if you're above 1,000 feet elevation).</li>
  
                                    <li><b>Cool and Store: </b> After processing, turn off heat and let jars sit for 5‚Äì10 minutes.

Remove jars carefully and place on a towel-lined surface.

After 24 hours, remove bands, check seals, and store in a cool, dark place.</li>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul class="ingredient-list">
      <li><b>Pomonas Pectin is a special type</b> of pectin that works well for low sugar jam and jelly recipes. There are no substitutes for it.</li>
      <li><b>If you choose not to can the jars,</b> they can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks. Alternatively, you can store them in the freezer for up to 1 year</li>
      <li><b>If you are at an altitude</b> of above 1000ft above sea level, add 1 minute of processing time for canning. Each additional 1000ft adds 1 minute more. For example someone canning at 4000 ft above sea level should add 4 minutes to the processing time. For this recipe that would be 14 minutes total.</li>
